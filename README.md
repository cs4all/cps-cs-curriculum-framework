# CPS CS Curriculum Framework
 This document serves as the curriculum framework for computer science education at Chicago Public Schools.

# Structure of this document
The framework is divided into strands (themes) and substrands (topics within themes). This structure mirrors other frameworks (e.g. [K-12 CS](k12cs.org) and standards (e.g. [CSTA](https://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/K12Standards.html)) that are in use around the country.
